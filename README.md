# ExchangeRatePredictions
This project is about time series analysis for exchange rate predictions for Euro Vs USD
This summary outlines the development of a time series model for predicting USD vs. EURO exchange rates. The project's primary goal is to create an accurate forecasting tool, involving data collection, preprocessing, model selection, training, and validation. Feature engineering and optimization will enhance prediction accuracy, leading to a deployable model for real-time or batch processing. Continuous monitoring and risk management strategies are emphasized, recognizing the inherent risks in exchange rate forecasting. The project aims to empower stakeholders with reliable insights for improved financial decision-making in international trade and investments.
